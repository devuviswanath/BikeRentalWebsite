                <p> It all began when <strong> Ajay </strong> decided to rent a jet ski for a day of fun. His girlfriend
                    who
                    lived out of town was coming to visit, so he hoped for a fun day with her and his close friends.
                    After
                    some research, he realized that his only option was to rent the jet ski out at a certain marina in
                    Ontario at an absolutely outrageous price of $90 per hour.</p>

                <p>Not only was he shocked by how expensive it was (he was planning to use the Jet Ski for at least half
                    a day) but was also frustrated to learn that we would have to remain within the jet ski owner’s line
                    of sight the entire time. After he spent some time debating how far the man could actually see, he
                    quickly realized that the planned adventure was not going to be as fun as he had originally
                    thought.He thought about how cool it would be to take a Sea Doo for a full day on a trailer, and
                    drive it to wherever he wanted, maybe even to multiple places on the same day, without having anyone
                    “supervise” him and his friends. Unfortunately, after some research, he realized such an option was
                    not available. He was disappointed to say the least, so he looked at how much it would cost to
                    actually own a jet ski.</p>
